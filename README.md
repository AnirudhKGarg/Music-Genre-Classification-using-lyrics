# Music-Genre-Classification-using-lyrics
# Abstract
# This project aims to build a system that can identify the genre of a song based on its lyrics. We identify a set of features that establish the style of a particular song. We curate a set of songs with ve labels - Rock, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Country and Pop. Then we design three models to classify the songs into their genres - Multi Layer Perceptron for multiclass classification, Random Forest for binary classification and Convolutional Neural Networks with word embeddings. We provide a user interface which would enable a user to input the lyrics of a particular song and our program would predict its genre based on the content of the lyrics.
